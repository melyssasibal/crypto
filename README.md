# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview 

The purpose of this project is to examine a dataset of cryptocurrencies. The data will first be preprocessed to fit machine learning models. As there is no known output, unsupervised learning, specifically through clustering algorithms, will be utilized to group cryptocurrencies to create a classification system.
